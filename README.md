- Being able to remove an item from the list;
- And make sure to always check for errors.

# Installation Instructions

### Technologies used
- Docker

### Installation
The backend is fully dockerized, and runs on port 1759. So the backend REST API Service will run at http://localhost:1759/api
- Download & Install Docker desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Navigate to the root directory of this project and run the following commands:
  - Run "docker-compose up -d" to setup all backend services and apps.
  - Run "docker exec -it bp_api sh" to enter the backend docker container shell and execute the following commands
      - php artisan optimize:clear
      - php artisan migrate
      - exit


## NB:
This project was done on holidays/vacation so i did not really have the time to complete the app. The only part remaining is writing automated tests for both the backend and frontend apps. If you have any questions or require more info running the app, please contact me on harsoftng@gmail.com.
